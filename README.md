# image_stitcher
A program which uses an image stitching algorithm that takes two input images, computes the best seam to join them, and produces a stitched image as the output.
The actual stitching logic is based on calculating seams and merging pixels along those seams.


The MatrixCuts class is designed to find optimal cuts in a matrix, which can be useful in various applications, including image processing and computer vision tasks where identifying important or least important parts of an image is necessary.
